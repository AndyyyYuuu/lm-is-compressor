  <h1>Language Model-Based Text Compression</h1>
    <i>An accurate language model can be converted into a high-compression, lossless text compressor. </i><br><br>
</div>

This repository is a demonstration of using a language model to perform lossless compression on natural language through some of the methods laid out by [Del√©tang et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10668). In it, I show that the use of GPT-2 models as part of an arithmetic coding algorithm, albeit extremely slow to run, can achieve compression rates of **< 20%** on English natural language. I also show that this compression rate can be improved through the use of more accurate language models. I hope you'll find this experiment interesting.

## Theoretical Foundation
With a piece of somewhat informal proof, we can show that better language models can indeed lead to smaller compressed files. 

Let us first explain the fundementals. **Shannon entropy**, or expected information content, of a distribution is given by taking the expected value of all the information contents $-log_2{P(X)} of possible events. 

$$H(P) = -\sum_x{P(x)log_2{P(x)}}$$

In our context, when $P(x)$ defines a distribution with varying probabilities for every possible text file, the entropy $H(P)$ defines the minimum number of bits needed to compress it. Entropy can also be interpreted as the unpredictability of a data source. If $P$ has more possible outcomes or contains less skewed probabilities (e.g. 50%-50% as opposed to 90%-10%), entropy increases, and more bits are required, on average, to compress its outcomes. 

Unfortunately, when it comes to compressing English text, we cannot know the true distribution $P$ of every possible text. Instead, we might use a distribution $P_\theta$ as a way to estimate $P$. We can update the lower bound for the length of our compressed file to the following, known as **cross-entropy**: 

$$H(P, P_\theta) = -\sum_x{P(x)log_2{P_\theta(x)}}$$

If we were to compress a file efficiently, we need to minimize the length of our output file and hence the value of cross-entropy $H(P, P_\theta)$. 

It also happens that cross-entropy is precisely the metric that is minimized in the pre-training process of modern Transformer language models. In that scenario, $P_\theta$ becomes our language model, which, as a result of optimization, is already in a state to minimize cross-entropy and thus the lower bound of the output code length. In other words, the more accurate a large language model is, the more effectively it compresses text.

## Arithmetic Coding

Arithmetic coding is employed as the base algorithm to perform text compression. 

Arithmetic coding works by mapping every possible sequence of symbols onto the number line between 0 and 1. We can thus use a single float to represent any sequence as a whole. Arithmetic coding divides the number line into a segment for each possible value of symbol 1. These divisions are further subdivided to encode symbol 2, and so on. 

<img width="855" alt="Arithmetic coding space with uniform distribution" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fb9280c-1f78-4705-9430-b94ed2fc3a79" />

This diagram shows an arithmetic coding algorithm with three symbols: "Hello", "world", and "!". The black bars at the bottom represent the intervals on the number line that encode each of the specified messages. 

It is important to note that any float within this interval is able to represent its message. The larger the interval, the more tolerence we have for the precision of this float. Thus, larger intervals correspond to less characters used to encode the message, while smaller intervals correspond to more characters. 

One of the principles of data compression is that we want more frequently occuring symbols to use less characters after compression. We can thus assign larger intervals to more likely sequences by **scaling our interval sizes with their corresponding probabilities**. These probabilities can be computed with a language model. After the addition of a language model, our algorithm might look more like this: 

<img width="855" alt="Arithmetic coding space with conditional distributions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97b89225-4bf5-479e-b9c9-eadeba85595d" />

As seen, sequences such as "Hello world !" are assigned much larger intervals than "! world !" and therefore shorter code length. Since "Hello world !" is much more likely, assigning it a shorter code length allows us to decrease the average length of our encoded files in the long run. 

A simplified algorithm for arithmetic coding with conditional probabilities of each symbol is shown below. The loop encodes a list of items sequentially, narrowing down the interval until it is small enough to uniquely represent the string. 
```py
def p_given(symbol: str, context: list) -> float:
    """Not implemented. Returns P(symbol | context)."""

def encode(sequence: list, alphabet: list) -> float:
  start = 0
  end = 1
  
  for c in range(len(sequence)): 
      location = alphabet.index(sequence[c])
      new_start = start

      for i in range(location):
          new_start += p_given(alphabet[i], sequence[:c]) * (end-start)  # scale down conditional probabilities based on current interval
      
      end = new_start + p_given(alphabet[location], sequence[:c]) * (end-start)
      start = new_start
  return (start + end) / 2  # take the midpoint of the interval
```

Here's something else cool. The code length of arithmetic coding is exactly 

$$\lceil -\sum_i{log_2{P_i(x)}} \rceil$$

where $P_i(x)$ is the conditional probability of token $i$ given by the language model. We can now deduct the exact length of our output. In the decoding process, knowing the output length ensures that we can stop the decoder before exceeding the original precision the file was encoded in.

## Implementation
The following section details the methods used to achieve the aforementioned task of converting a language model into a data compressor. 

### Arithmetic Coding

This project uses [nayuki/Reference-arithmetic-coding](https://github.com/nayuki/Reference-arithmetic-coding) to perform arithmetic coding. The above algorithm is heavily constrained by the precision of Python floats. [nayuki/Reference-arithmetic-coding](https://github.com/nayuki/Reference-arithmetic-coding) overcomes this by using Python integer types as representations of floats. Wondrously, Python `int`s have functionally no upper limit. 

### Language Models

I primarily used [GPT-2 Small](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) to run this compressor, but other models from Hugging Face have been tested as well. They are listed below: 
- [GPT-2 Small](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) (124M parameters)
- [GPT-2 Medium](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2-medium) (355M parameters)
- [GPT-2 Large](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2-large) (774M parameters)
- [Llama 3.2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) (1B parameters)
- [Llama 3.2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B) (3B parameters)

In the source code, the distributions of possible next tokens are computed for every token simultaneously by inputting the entire string into the LLM. A BOS (Beginning of Text) token is placed before the string to give the language model context upon which it builds the first character's distribution. 

### Chunk Processing
GPT-2 has a limited context length and will throw an error if you attempt to calculate distributions for sequences longer than 1024 tokens. Therefore, I split longer text files into chunks of 1023 tokens, one less than 1024 to make space for an extra BOS token before each chunk. Each compressed chunk is placed in a `.bin` file inside a folder representing a compressed file. 

Llama 3.2 has a ridiculous context length of 128K tokens. For consistency's sake, I used the same chunking scheme of 1024 tokens for it. 

While the splitting of input text definitely decreases the capabilities of the language model by limiting its context, it significantly increases its efficiency. An alternative solution would have been to implement a 1024-token moving window, ensuring the LLM always has 1024 tokens of context to work with. Unfortunately, the aforementioned batch inference would not have been possible with this solution. 

### KV-Caching
KV-caching was used to accelerate language model inference in the decompression process, where the distribution of the next token was iteratively computed until the entire sequence was restored. 

In a transformer, the three values key (K), query (Q), and value (V) are computed for each input token. K and V are fixed for each token at their specific position. Therefore, if we have already computed the distribution for the next token of "Hello my name", we no longer need to do as much work for "Hello my name is" as the KV for the first 3 words had already been computed. With my models, this is done by getting the `.past_key_values` attribute from language model outputs and then plugging it back into the model's `past_key_values` parameter for the next iteration. 

The addition of KV-caching can decrease inference time significantly: 

<img width="700" alt="kv_cache_effects" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c13198ae-22db-4f3d-8048-a8e56f8cf720" />

As seen from the graph, the algorithm without KV-caching experiences a linear increase in decoding time per token. The number of tokens for the language model to process increases for every additional token until the decoder moves on to the next chunk of data. On the other hand, KV-caching allows each inference to be performed in a relatively fixed amount of time by only computing the K and V for the last token added every iteration.

## Experimental Results
These experiments on my data compressor were run using the files in [`texts`](texts). I used [Weights & Biases](wandb.org) and Google Sheets to log and create graphs for my results. 
### Compression Rate for Natural Language
I initially used GPT-2 Small to test the compression rates of 4 text files of varying size. See [`testing.py`](testing.py) for testing code. 

<img width="500" alt="Compression Rates on Various Natural Language Texts" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54a26c37-3243-4a08-8abd-a19d9800f5aa" />

The x-axis of the graph represents the compression rate of the compressor on various files (compression rate is compressed file size / uncompressed file size). 
From the graph, we see that compression rate is around 20% for large text files. This means that the compressor is able to reduce english text files to one-fifth of their original size. The large compression rate of `sentence.txt` is likely due to decreased language modeling accuracy as a result of the small amount of context. 

### Comparison With Other Methods & Models

![Compression Rates of Various Methods](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a0418f-84e9-402c-81e3-fab026c4f9f5)

For the natural language files in [`texts`](texts), GPT-2 Small arithmetic coding consistently outperforms ZIP in compression rate. It also far outperforms weaker language models, such as a static uniform distribution, on arithmetic coding. 

I notice that the compression rate of ZIP seems to decrease as file size increases. I will run further tests on larger files. 

![Compression Rates of GPT-2 Sizes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0ef2e64-e3c5-4101-bcc8-23643bfac933)

I also compared the compression rates of GPT-2 [Small](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2), [Medium](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2-medium), and [Large](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2-large) models, finding that for the three sample texts, larger, more capable versions of the model always outperform their smaller counterparts. This is consistent with the [heuristic proof](#theoretical-foundation) showing a positive correlation between LM accuracy and file reduction.

## Limitations & Further Experiments
This data compressor is extremely slow. Arithmetic coding is a major efficiency bottleneck for each run. A possible solution is to integrate my Python code with arithmetic coding written in C. 

Because of this issue, the 3 texts I used for this experiment are very small on the scale of data compression, as larger texts would simply take too long. The models I used also needed to be small enough to run locally on my MacBook without crashing it. 

I invite any readers with sufficient time / hardware to try running this with larger models or datasets.
